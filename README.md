**Rate_My_Cricketer**

This is an application inspired by "Hot or Not" (Acquired by MTV) as well as "Rate My Professor". This application allows you to rate and compare your cricketers on multiple parameters. This was a pre IPL and pre 2020 interface. 

**Reason for Stalling of the Product**

It is very difficult to acquire assets like photographs of players without copyright. For example ESPN bought CricInfo. Wisden is the cricket behemoth. So for an entry level entrepreneur, we need to do lot of tie-ups with content providers. "Hot or Not" (I am rated 3.7 out of 10 :() or "Facebook" require the users to upload their own photograph ("You are the product"). That was not common during the genesis of this application. Now if you could convince cricketers to upload their photographs into this application, the entrepreneur will succeed.

**Pivot Point**

A pivot point was the other big craze of India (other than Bollywood and Cricket) : Astrology. So we planned to launch "Rate My Astrologer" after the same.
